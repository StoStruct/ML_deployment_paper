# 2. Example 1: Model overfitting and adaptive cross-validation


## 2.1 Files in the repository
- **Benchmarking_example.csv & results.csv:** Includes copies of the dataset used in Example 1 of the paper. 

- **stressor_trial_1.R:** Includes unpublished stressor trial results, which were used to 
  inform the selection of Random Forests as a comparison model. 

- **1_variable_explorations.R:** Includes the code necessary to reproduce Figures 3 and 4 as 
  well as Table 1 in the paper
  
# 3. Example 2: Model Underspecification and explainability


## 3.1 Files in the repository
- **210611 Shear Wall Drift Capacity Dataset.xlsx:** The dataset that contains experimental data on the drift capacity of shear walls
- **Interpretation_Code_ShearWalls.ipynb:** The Jupyter notebook for the second example that contains the main code for model fitting and interpretation
